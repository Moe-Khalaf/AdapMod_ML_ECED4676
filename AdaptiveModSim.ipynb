        "## 1. Description\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook contains the project for ECED 4676. The objective of this\n",
        "project is to model an adaptive modulation communication link.\n",
        "\n",
        "This communication link is to be catered towards underwater communications, and as such, will be dealing with multipath and additive white gaussian noise. The particular schemes to be featured in this adaptive modulation link are\n",
        "- B-FSK\n",
        "- 4-FSK\n",
        "- 8-FSK\n",
        "\n",
        "B-FSK will be used to accomodate the harshest of conditions while 8-FSK will be used to accomodate the most favorable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The way that this model will work is by assessing the bit error rate and time to transmit of a particular bitstream. Afterwards, this model will repeat the process using a fixed modulation system of each of the three selected modulation schemes. This way, the effectiveness of the adaptive modulation can be assessed against its fixed alternatives."
